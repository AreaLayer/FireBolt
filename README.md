## Overview

Cypherpunk App

Firebolt is a wallet designed by a Bitcoiner for Bitcoiners looking for privacy using Payjoin, Lightning Network, Coinjoin, Bitcoin and Nostr

Each individual has their own identity using Nostr

## The problem

Central Banks and cetralized social media

## Firebolt's solution

Firebolt offers a Bitcoin wallet that supports both on-chain and lightning transactions. The application runs a custom, non-routing Lightning node created with the Lightning Development Kit on the user's mobile phone. 

Users can back up their Bitcoin and Lightning keys with a standard BIP-39 seed and optional password. Lightning channels data is only saved in third party if you use Lightning Node.

The other main features Firebolt supports are as follows:

üì± Contact list via Npub

ü™ô Payments via Lightning Network
