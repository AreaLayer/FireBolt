## Overview

Save your self sovereign

Firebolt is a wallet designed by a Bitcoiner for Bitcoiners looking for privacy using Payjoin, Lightning Network, Coinjoin, Bitcoin, Hypercore, Nostr and TBD

Each individual has their own identity using Nostr or TBD according to their preference

## The problem

Central Banks, inflations and cetralized social media

## Firebolt's solution

Firebolt offers a Bitcoin wallet that supports both on-chain and lightning transactions. The application runs a custom, non-routing Lightning node created with the Lightning Development Kit on the user's mobile phone. By default, you connect to Area Layer's Electrum-Bitcoin Core server, but you can also connect to your own server. We onboard users to Lightning through our lightning service provider (LSP) Timelight.

Users can back up their Bitcoin and Lightning keys with a standard BIP-39 seed and optional password. Lightning channels data is only saved in our sever if you use our Lightning Node, if not we'll not save your lightning channel data

The other main features Firebolt supports are as follows:
